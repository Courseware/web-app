# Coding style

## Vim

If you are using Vim, consider [my `.vimrc`](https://github.com/stas/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc)

## JavaScript / CoffeeScript

We pretty much follow [Idiomatic.js style](https://github.com/rwldrn/idiomatic.js).

Code style for indentation, strip white spaces and use single quotes where
possible!
